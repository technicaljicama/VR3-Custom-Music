# VR3-Custom-Music
A quick and dirty script for Virtual Rides 3 to play custom music
## This is only going to work with the latest version on steam! (Working as of 5.8.35)
## Currently only for linux (I guess)
# How-To:
- Grab resources.resource from `/steamapps/common/Virtual Rides 3/VR3_Data/` and place it in the current working directory.
- Make a backup of that file in case you want the original song back!
- Run `python patcher.py`
- After the script is done, replace resources.resource.patched and put it to the same folder you got it from, renamed as `resources.resource`.
- In the game, when you try to play "Virtual Rides - Fresh Beats", your custom song should appear!
